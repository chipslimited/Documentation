## Operating System
A group of software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as scheduling tasks, executing applications, and controlling peripherals. 

## Blockchain
Blockchains are immutable digital ledger systems implemented in a distributed fashion (i.e., without a central repository) and usually without a central authority. At their most basic level,  they enable a community of users to record transactions in a ledger that is public to that community, such that no transaction can be changed once published. The most significant blockchain product so far is Bitcoin.
